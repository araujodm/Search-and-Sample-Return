# Search-and-Sample-Return
Project #1 from Udacity ND Robotics

I didnt do to much different from the walkthrough video but only adjusting settings as max speed, stop_forward, go_forward.
To be honest, I have been trying for about 1 week already, but more I change, worse results I got.
I will keep trying but I think it is time to move forward.

All things here a quite new to me. From Anaconda to Jupyter and also Git and Python.
Considering that, even doing my best, still hard to send better results because also my mother language is not English and it is my first time using Mac.

For me, nothing is better than hard challenges like that, so, thanks for being patient.
Best regards,
Daniel Araujo
